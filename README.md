## Goal
Goal here is to manage database directly from code.
In this purpose, we will make use of EF.Core to Scaffold existing entities.

## Run the project (locally)
To run the project locally, you first need to set the local db connection string.
To do that, cf https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/quickstart-dotnet-core-app#build-and-run-the-app-locally
